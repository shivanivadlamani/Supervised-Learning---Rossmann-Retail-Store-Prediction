Linear Regression: A linear regression model finds a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. It aims to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values by adjusting the model coefficients. Linear regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm but it assumes a linear relationship between the input features and output variable which may not always hold true.

Lasso Regression: Lasso stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. It is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function to encourage sparsity in the model coefficients. This results in a simpler model with fewer features. Lasso is useful when the dataset has many features and some of them may not be relevant.

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is another type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function but instead of encouraging sparsity, it restricts the magnitude of the coefficients. This helps to reduce the effect of multicollinearity, which is when two or more features are highly correlated.

Decision Tree Regressor: A decision tree regressor builds a tree-like model by recursively splitting the dataset based on the input features. It predicts the output variable by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node that corresponds to the predicted value. Decision trees are simple and interpretable but they can easily overfit the training data.

Random Forest Regressor: A random forest regressor is an ensemble of decision tree regressors. It works by constructing multiple decision trees on random subsets of the training data and then averaging their predictions. Random forests are less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree.

XGBRegressor: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a gradient boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners into a strong learner. It works by iteratively adding new trees to the model that minimize the residual errors of the previous trees. XGBoost is highly customizable and can handle large datasets but may be prone to overfitting.

AdaBoost Regressor: AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is another boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners. It works by adjusting the weights of the training data based on the errors of the previous models. AdaBoost is less customizable than XGBoost but can still achieve good performance with simple models.
